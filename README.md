# py-cppbuild

Small utility for building certain libraries from source

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

The following are necessary for the program to function

-   [python 3.10.5](https://www.python.org/),
-   [poetry 1.1.5](https://python-poetry.org/)

### Usage

The [run.sh](run.sh) script gives some details as to how to run the program.
The following launch parameters are necessary:

```
    --action    "build"|"clean"     Builds or cleans the dependencies
    --root_path <path>              Must be the same directory, where the 'vendor' directory is present
    --deps <list[str]>              List of space-delimited strings that reflect the name
                                    of the directory for the specific dependency
```

The `vendor` directory is where all the sources for libraries are collected for any given project.

Each directory in `vendor` must be a dependency or a library that we wish to build and then transfer to the `deps` folder, which is where built libraries are stored

### Building process

The tool is going to create directories in the specified root path for the project, such as `build` and `deps`.
Those directories are respectively responsible for intermediate build generation (like Makefiles generated by CMake or Visual Studio solution/project files) and the built dependencies

If the dependency has an `include` folder at its root, it will be copied over to `deps/<name of dependency>/include`
If the dependency has libraries, they will be built and copied to `deps/<name of dependency>/bin`
